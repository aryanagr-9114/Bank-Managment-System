## Purpose

The files inside appear to be part of a Java-based banking management project (source code, resources, SQL schema, or related artifacts).

## How to use

1. Download and unzip this archive.
2. Inspect the listed files. If there is a `src/` folder, import it into an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code with Java support).
3. If a `sql/` or `schema.sql` file exists, create a MySQL database and run that script to create required tables.
4. Configure database connection values in any `config.properties` or `DBConnection.java` present.
5. Ensure the MySQL JDBC driver (mysql-connector-java) is available on the classpath before building/running.


## Quick setup checklist

- [ ] Java JDK 8 or newer installed.
- [ ] MySQL server available and running.
- [ ] JDBC driver on classpath or added as project dependency.
- [ ] Update configuration (`config.properties` or similar) with DB credentials.
